Hi there! Welcome to the site. I hope you will find the information on this blog and podcast interesting and helpful.

The main focus of the content that I create is visual accessibility in modern board games. I analyze various tabletop games and try to come up with solutions that would make them more accessible for blind and visually impaired playerse. The solutions that I come up with can vary from physically modifying the games, using replacement game pieces, or using smartphones and other tech products. I also develop board game adaptations for Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa, so that blind people can independently be able to experience a wider range of games.
