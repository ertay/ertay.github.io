Recently I was interviewed by Alex who is the host of the Time For Your Hobby podcast where I talked about my experiences as a blind board gamer. We talked about how I was introduced to the hobby, my favorite games, the challenges I have as a blind board game enthusiast, and more. 

Time For Your Hobby is a podcast where anyone can pull up a seat and talk to Alex about their hobbies. The main objective of this podcast is to share various hobbies people have, what impact their hobby has made in their lives, as well as getting rid of misconceptions about particular hobbies. The  podcast is available on all of the popular platforms and you can find them [on the official Time For Your Hobby site.](https://timeforyourhobby.wixsite.com/podcast){:target="_blank"}
