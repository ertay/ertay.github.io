Become the captain of a spaceship and face the onslaught of alien threats in this resource management strategy game!

If you have been following my [development logs]({{ site.baseurl }}/boardgames/deep-space-d6-alexa-development-log-one/){:target="_blank"}, you are already aware that in the past month I was working on adapting the free print-and-play version of Deep Space D-6 for Alexa. The first version is now ready and you can enable the Alexa Skill for free!

You will notice that the Alexa Skill name is 'Deep Space Dice' and the main reason for this is to make it easier for Alexa to detect the name.

## Game Overview

You are the Captain of the USS Crypsis - a RPTR class starship on routine patrol of the Auborne system when a distress call was received. Upon warping in you quickly realize it was a trap! With the help of your crew, you must survive until a rescue fleet appears.

Deep Space Dice is a solitaire dice game about surviving the cruel depths of space. Each turn youâ€™ll roll Crew dice and assign them to stations. You must plan carefully to take care of internal and external threats to your ship. Survive to win.

## How To Launch Deep Space Dice On Your Alexa Device

To start playing the game, all you need to do is say "Alexa, enable Deep Space Dice". If you encounter any problems launching the game with that command, you can enable the skill from the [Skill's page](https://www.amazon.com/Ertay-Shashko-Deep-Space-Dice/dp/B08B1481NR/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=deep+space+dice&qid=1592052831&s=digital-skills&sr=1-1){:target="_blank"}. Deep Space Dice is available for all English locales (US, Canada, UK, Australia, and India).

Happy hunting, Captain!
