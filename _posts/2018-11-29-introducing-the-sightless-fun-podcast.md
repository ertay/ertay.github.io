Mic check, one, two, three... test. OK, looks like we're good to go!

I'm very excited to share this with you. We've been working on starting a podcast for the past couple of months and today we're publishing our first, intro episode!

We plan to release a new episode every other Thursday. Each episode we will be taking a look at the visual accessibility of a certain game followed by a discussion about a specific topic. Occasionally, we plan to have a guest on the show to spice things up a bit.

You can listen to our podcast here on our website or on any of the following podcast platforms:

In this intro episode, Ertay and Jed introduce themselves and talk about how they got into the hobby of Board Games, what challenges they have as legally blind players, and why Ertay started the Sightless Fun blog.
